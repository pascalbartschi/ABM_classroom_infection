### Model Assumptions



### Research Question Ideas

* How does spacing between students affect infections per day?
  hyperparameter: spacing, rest is fixed
  Our prediction: H1, The greater spacing the more infections per day

* How does number of students per class affect infections per day?
  hyperparameter: room_size, rest is fixed, but spacing has to be high
  Our prediction: H1, More students, more mixing, more infections per day
  
* How does viral potency (radius) affect infections per day?
  hyperparameter: viral_radius_factor
  Our prediction: H1: Higher factor, more infections
  
* #### How do these different aspects of classroom dimensions, which are a proxy for classroom costs, affect infections per day
