### Description
Globalization and increasing numbers of students increase the risk for epidemics on different scales. This semester project suggests an approach, based on Agent-Based-Modelling, to optimize classroom size relative to their cost  to keep the infection rate low in universities.

### Model Assumptions

* After 7 days are all students recovered, regardless of  the timepoint of infection during the 7 days​
* At first day of the week 10% of the students randomly infected  
* Square Classroom dimension ->  Number of students per class must be a squared number
* Students are distributed into classes randomly and the seating is random as well
* Given student is infected in class n, virus can be infect other students in class n+1 and student infected in n will be home from class n+2 until new week starts 
* No immunization after an infection​
* Infections only in the classroom possible ​
* Fixed Beta ​= 0.001

### Research Question

-> What is the optimal classroom size too keep the attendance high and the costs low?

* How does number of students per class affect the infections per week?
  Prediction: more students lead to more interactions causing higher infection rates

* How does the distance between students affect the infections per week?
  Prediction: The smaller the distance between students the more infections per week
